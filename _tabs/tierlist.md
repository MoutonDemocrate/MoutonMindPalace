# Tierlist

**Warning : This tierlist isn't trying to be objective, and is just my heavily biased opinion.**

_Also, there's a difference between "in my opinion, the best >thing< ever made" and "my favourite >thing< ever made_

To explain the tiers a bit :

- ### S Tier
  - Reserved for art that genuinely changed the way I see certain things, oftentimes overwriting my understanding of many concepts.
  - Ex : **Outer Wilds** and **Hyper Light Drifter** helped my abstract the concept of "death", of an "end". **Hollow Knight** made me reevaluate my entire idea of what a game was, and **Super Mario Galaxy** made me understand what art is supposed to feel like.
- ### A Tier
  - Didn't make me question life itself, but still really fucking good. If I hadn't played **Super Mario Galaxy** at a really young age, or if I hadn't experienced **Hollow Knight** exactly during my artistic formative years, they'd be A Tier.
- ### B Tier
  - Almost excellent, oftentimes held back by really simple details, like **Splatoon** which, to me, held back too much on art direction and expressiveness.
- ### C Tier
  - Great work, would recommend after experiencing it, but wouldn't gush about it like I do with my favourites.
- ### D Tier
  - Good, but nothing more, or bad but with potential. Most triple AAAs end up here.
- ### E Tier
  - Plain bad. Not even bad enough to hate it. Chucked into the void and never brought up again.
- ### F Tier
  - Terrible. To the point where I actively hate this piece of media. Would recommend NOT to experience it.
