    desc: "My favourite video game.\n
    This shit is the bee knee's and I don't fuck around with those words.\n
    Ambience, exploration, gameplay, story, soundtrack - this game has it all."

  - name: "Super Mario Galaxy"
    desc: "My second favourite favourite video game.\n
    Level design ? Yes, of course. Soundtrack ? Fucking amazing. Ambience ? Probably the best in any game I've played.\n
    This shit rocks."

  - name: "Outer Wilds"
    desc: "A knowledge-based puzzle game - any spoilers can ruin the experience PERMANENTLY.\n
    Helped me abstract the concept of death.\n
    10/10"

  - name: "Hyper Light Drifter"
    desc: "A fast-paced 2D RPG.\n
    A masterpiece in level design, ambience, and world building, all packed in a short playthrough."

  - name: "Zelda : Twilight Princess"
    desc: "The first Zelda game that really impacted me.\n
    It lacks in a lot of area, but makes up for it with incredible ambience, and an immersive story and universe."

  - name: "Splatoon 2 : Octo Expansion"
    desc: "The best content in the Splatoon series, and the only reason anyone would buy Splatoon 2 now.\n
    The vaporwave aesthetic is exquisite, excellent level design and gameplay."


A:
  - name: "Bloodborne"
    desc: "My favourite Soulslike game..\n
    I really like the aesthetic of this game. The combat feels good and the lore is great. But the Lovecraftian horror is what brings it up so much."

  - name: "Tunic"
    desc: "Another knowledge-based puzzle game with quick combat gameplay.\n
    Tunic is great - from the art style to the puzzles. It's a really nice experience that's 10 times deeper than what it appears."

  - name: "Zelda : Breath of the Wild"
    desc: "Looking at it objectively, probably the best 3D Zelda game.\n
    While the world can feel a bit empty, and the UI is definitely not the best, the game's atmosphere and terrain are god damn marvelous, and the world building is quite good as well."

  - name: "Splatoon 3"
    desc: "Octo Expansion's formula, revisited with incredible art direction and soundtrack - not uncommon for Splatoon games.\n
    It does lack a bit in inovation compared to Octo Expansion, but the realisation is perfect, so who can complain.\n"

  - name: "Titanfall 2"
    desc: "The pinnacle of FPS campaigns, for 3â‚¬.\n
    Although quite short, the campaign is great - incredible gameplay, environnements, and level design."

B:
  - name: "Zelda : Tears of the Kingdom"
    desc: "Not to be an asshole or anything, but despite being good, this game feels like it was made by the executives who wanted Breath of the Wild 2.\n
    The game is great, but it's just Breath of the Wild again, and the additions do not make up for how dissapointingly mild the game was."

  - name: "Splatoon"
    desc: "The start of a great saga with a great gameplay foundation.\n
    Some of the best level design I have witnessed, with insane soundtrack and world building.\n
    I wish it hadn't held back on art direction. It looks almost neutered compared to other games in the series."

  - name: "Super Mario Galaxy 2"
    desc: "Not what I wanted for a second installment in the series...\n
    Ambience got gutted in favor of better levels, and while the soundtrack is good, it's very underutilised and sometimes even just not used correctly."

  - name: "Celeste"
    desc: "Good soundtrack, good level design & gameplay, not much else to say.\n
    Celeste is just... a great game. But that's it. It's pretty but never gorgeous, fun but never exhilarating, it's just a solid, great game."

C:
  - name: "Splatoon 2"
    desc: "A good game, but dissapointing compared to Splatoon 1 & 3.\n
    What it lacks in freshness or inventive gameplay, it makes up for with great level design.\n
    It's just dissapointing and doesn't really expand on Splatoon 1's campaign."

  - name: "Dauntless"
    desc: "(Talking about the game before The Incident).\n
    Very fun monster hunting game more focused on learning enemy paterns than anything else.\n
    Art direction was good, monsters were nice and gameplay was fluid. I'll miss those nights of hiding the Switch in my room to play Dauntless until 3am..."

D:
  - name: "Starbound"
    desc: "Once a great game that could've been an excellent game but ended up a good game.\n
    Starbound's beta was better than the final game we have today.\n
    Chucklefish abandonned it and although the modding community is one of the best in history, the game is just... not great. Not bad, but not great."

F:
  - name: "Dauntless : Awakening"
    desc: "Oh, how deep fall those who once soared high...\n
    Whodda thunk that getting bought by a crypto company would ruin a game ! There's nothing left : monster intelligence was gutted, performance worsened and art direction was neutered. And you have to pay for weapons instead of crafting them from monster parts...\n I'll miss you, buddy."
